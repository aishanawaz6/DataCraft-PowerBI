## Project Overview
Welcome to the Power BI Project on Analyzing Ransomware Attacks! In this journey, I've dived into the realm of ransomware attack data, utilizing Power BI to uncover insights into the frequency, impact, and patterns of these attacks. The dataset provides rich information about various ransomware attacks, including the target industry, affected entities, attack dates, and ransom amounts demanded.

## Completed Tasks

### Task 1: Data Exploration
1. Downloaded the ransomware attacks data set from the provided link.
2. Imported the data set into Power BI.
3. Explored the data to understand its structure and addressed any data quality issues.

### Task 2: Attack Overview
1. Created a bar chart visualizing the distribution of ransomware attacks by target industry.
2. Generated a line chart displaying the time overview, revealing patterns over months or years.

### Task 3: Geospatial Analysis
1. Utilized Power BI's mapping capabilities to plot ransomware attacks on a world map, showcasing the most affected countries.
2. Added drill-down functionality to analyze attacks at regional or city levels.

### Task 4: Severity of Attacks
1. Analyzed the severity of attacks by calculating the average number of affected entities and the median ransom amount.
2. Visualized the severity metrics using suitable charts such as bar charts and box plots.

### Task 5: Most Targeted Industries
1. Identified the top 5 industries most frequently targeted by ransomware attacks.
2. Created a donut chart visualizing the percentage distribution of attacks across these industries.

### Task 6: Ransom Amount Analysis
1. Analyzed the ransom amounts demanded by ransomware attackers.
2. Created a histogram to showcase the distribution of ransom amounts.

### Task 7: Time Series Analysis
1. Performed time series analysis to identify seasonality or trends in ransomware attacks.
2. Utilized time series visualizations like line charts and seasonal decomposition.

### Task 8: Impact and Recovery
1. Investigated the recovery rate and average downtime of entities affected by ransomware attacks.
2. Visualized recovery metrics using charts such as bar charts and gauge charts.

### Task 9: Data Insights and Conclusion
1. Summarized key findings and insights obtained from the ransomware attacks analysis.
2. Created a comprehensive report page/dashboard showcasing vital visualizations and conclusions.

### Task 10: Data Storytelling
1. Crafted a compelling data storytelling presentation using Power BI's storytelling feature or PowerPoint integration to convey the impact and severity of ransomware attacks.

### Task 11: Dashboard Interactivity
1. Enhanced the dashboard's interactivity by adding filters, slicers, and drill-through options, providing a detailed exploration of the data.
