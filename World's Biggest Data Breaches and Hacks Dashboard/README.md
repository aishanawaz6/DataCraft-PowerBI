## Tasks: Advanced Data Transformations and Measures

Welcome to the advanced stage of the World's Biggest Data Breaches and Hacks Dashboard project! In this phase, advanced data transformations and measures using Power BI have been applied to the provided dataset. Let's dive into the tasks accomplished:

### Task 1: Data Transformation with Power Query Editor
1. Loaded the dataset "worlds-biggest-data-breaches-and-hacks.csv" into Power BI using Power Query Editor.
2. Cleaned the data by handling missing values, duplicates, and other data quality issues.
3. Created a new query to filter and select relevant columns for analysis.
4. Merged this new query with another dataset or performed a join with external data to enrich the analysis.

### Task 2: Appending Data from Multiple Files
1. Downloaded additional files from the dataset source containing related information.
2. Appended these files to the existing dataset in Power BI.
3. Ensured that the appended data is properly aligned, and relationships are maintained.

### Task 3: Unpivoting Columns for Visualization
1. Identified columns in the dataset that would benefit from being unpivoted.
2. Used Power Query Editor to unpivot these columns to reshape the data into a more suitable format for visualization.
3. Applied necessary transformations to make the data ready for visualization.

### Task 4: Creating Calculated Columns with DAX
1. Analyzed the dataset and identified calculated columns that would add value to the analysis.
2. Wrote DAX expressions to create these calculated columns (e.g., calculating breach severity based on the number of records exposed and impact categories).

### Task 5: Creating Measures with DAX
1. Defined business metrics crucial for the analysis (e.g., YoY growth, running totals of breaches, or average sales of breached records).
2. Wrote DAX measures to calculate these metrics, making use of appropriate DAX functions and time intelligence if required.

### Task 6: Building a Dashboard with Insights
1. Designed and built a visually appealing and insightful dashboard using the transformed data, calculated columns, and measures.
2. Included appropriate visualizations like line charts, bar charts, and tables to represent the analyzed metrics effectively.
3. Used slicers or filters to allow users to interact with the data and explore different aspects of the breaches and hacks dataset.
